uTomate Changelog
=================

Change log
----------

Version 1.3.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Note: Starting with the next version of uTomate (1.4.0) we will drop support for Unity versions below 4.2.0. Older 
  versions of uTomate will remain available for existing customers outside of the Unity Asset Store.
* Improvement: The "Build Lightmaps" action is now capable of using the settings from the currently open scene. This way
               you can easily define bake settings per scene without having to create one new "Build Lightmaps" action
               for each scene in case you want to have per-scene settings.
* Fix: Fixed name clash with multi-platform-toolkit asset.
* Fix: Added a workaround about an undocumented Unity API discrepancy on Windows Phone 8 and Metro build targets.



Version 1.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improvement: It is now possible to export parts of your project settings into a Unity package. 
* Fix: Custom scripts are now properly loaded from script assemblies by the find GameObjects action.

Version 1.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New Feature: New "Touch Files" action which allows to set the modification date of files to the current date.
               This is useful for triggering reimports.
* Improvement: The result file of the Build DLL action does no longer need to end with .dll.
* Improvement: It's now possible to build a DLL without referencing the Unity.dll. This is useful if you want to
               build DLLs for other Unity versions than the one which is currently running.
* Improvement: The scripting API can now implicitely convert a quaternion to a Vector3. This is helpful when 
               assigning the rotation of an object to a Vector3. With this implicit conversion you now just need
               to type "$gameObject.transform.rotation" instead of "$gameObject.transform.rotation.eulerAngles".
* Improvement: The "Editor Properties" and "Project properties" tabs in the main window are now scrollable.              
* Fix: The "Add platform extension" flag of the "Build Player" action now works correctly with Unity 4.1 and 4.3.    
* Fix: The "Build Player" action now correctly handles the fact that Unity 4.1 has a build platform 
       "StandaloneOSXUniversal" but doesn't support builds for this platform. If this platform is chosen 
       the action will silently build a "StandaloneOSXIntel" build.              

Version 1.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New Feature: New action set for scene manipulation - Create Scene, Instanciate Prefab, Find Game Object in Scene, 
  Modify Game Object, etc.
* New Feature: For-Each-File entry can now also select folders.
* New Feature: For-Each and For-Each-File entries now optionally set an index property with the numeric index of the 
  currently iterated item.
* New Feature: new built-in property $utomate:debugMode which allows to run parts of the plan only if debug mode is 
  enabled. 
* New Feature: compatible with Unity 4.3.
* Improvement: Build Asset Bundle action no longer requires a main asset.
* Improvement: Build Asset Bundle action no longer requires to set any asset bundle option.
* Improvement: When selecting an action in the automation plan editor, it will as well be selected in the inspector.
* Improvement: Notes can now be connected to other automation plan entries and are auto-layouted as well.
* Fix: Performance optimizations to ensure smooth operation in very large projects.
* Fix: Backslashes in editor settings are now handled more gracefully.
* Fix: The "Run in Background" value of the player settings is no longer be reset when running an automation plan.

Version 1.2.1

* New Feature: Added action for reloading Unity's asset database.
* Improvement: Ensured compatibility with Unity 4.2
* Improvement: uTomate no longer has compile errors if you have a class named "Attribute" in your project.


Version 1.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New Feature: Quickly run an automation plan by pressing Cmd+K (Ctrl+K on Windows).
* New Feature: Quickly edit an automation plan by pressing Cmd+Shift+K (Ctrl+Shift+K on Windows).
* New Feature: Quickly locate an automation plan in the project tree by pressing Cmd+Option+K (Ctrl+Alt+K on Windows).
* New Feature: The list in the uTomate main window can now be operated with the keyboard.
* New Feature: Run an automation plan from the main window by double-clicking it.
* New Feature: Edit, Locate and Run plans from the main window by right-clicking a plan and selecting the respective
               action from the context menu.

* New Feature: A new action for setting scripting compilation define symbols. 
* New Feature: A new action for asserting conditions. Useful to abort an automation run if a file is missing etc.
* New Feature: A new action for opening a folder in Explorer/Finder. This action was kindly contributed by Jean Fabre.
* New Feature: Script Extensions. It's now possible to write extension objects that can be used inside uTomate's scripts.
* New Feature: File Script Extension. A new script extension providing several useful operations on files an paths
               e.g. converting a full path to a project relative path, get the file name of a path or checking if
               a target file is older than a source file.
* New Feature: Context Script Extension. Allows to modify the context from within scripts (e.g. check if a property 
               is set, etc.).
* New Feature: Several new built-in properties ($unity:version, $unity:supportsAndroid, $unity:supportsIos).
* Improvement: Set Property action now has a flag which allows to set the property only if it is not yet set.
* Improvement: TextAreas in inspectors now have a proper height.
* Improvement: Errors in evaluated scripts now produce a much better error message.
* Fix: The string property renderer will no longer throw an exception when rendering an action with a plain string

Version 1.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New Feature: Added actions for modifiying player settings for Windows, Mac, Linux (Unity 4 only), Web Player,
               iOS and Android build targets. 
* New Feature: Added action for waiting a few seconds. Useful when waiting for external processes or for implementing
               retry-loops.
* New Feature: Inspector renderer is now much more extensible. Custom property renderers can be defined for new
               property types, so you can now create your own UTxyz properties in a pluggable way.
* Improvement: uTomate now detects if the project is recompiled while it is running and locks the reloading of
               assemblies until the current automation plan has finished. This prevents the plan execution from
               being aborted unexpectedly.
* Improvement: You can now run automation plans from their inspector panel.
* Improvement: Inspector now gives better feedback when a required property is not entered.
* Improvement: Inspector now highlights probable configuration errors in Run external program action.
* Improvement: Run external program action now allows to specify a working directory.
* Improvement: uTomate's main window now tries to dock next to the inspector.
* Improvement: Sub-Plans are now marked with a special icon in the automation plan editor.
* Fix: Automatic file extension is no longer offered by the "Build Player" action for the iOS build target 
       as Unity is actually not building an IPA file when building a player for iOS. The option was therefore removed
       to avoid confusion.
* Fix: Warning messages will now display correctly on properties having a folder select option.
* Fix: Delete file action will no longer throw an exception if the file to delete has already been deleted.
* Fix: GUID of automation plans is now stored in a field named diffrently from "guid" to prevent interference 
  with Unity's external VCS feature. This change will unfortunately wipe all the statistics recorded for the build
  plans as these are tied to the serialized GUID. If you are still getting GUID error messages after upgrading to
  1.1.0 please check our FAQ: http://docs.ancientlightstudios.com/display/UT/Frequently+Asked+Questions
* Fix: Automation plan statistics are no longer cleared when you switch to a different project.
* Fix: Run external program action now no longer throws an exception when running it outside of debug mode.
* Fix: Plans running other plans recursively can now be properly cancelled.


Version 1.0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improvement: It is now possible to move the Chili4U and uTomate folders into a subfolder without breaking the editor.
* Fix: When switching to iOS or Android build targets, there are no more compiler errors.


Version 1.0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Full Source Code is included now
* Added option to run a plan to the plan's context menu.
* Actions that access the internet now display a warning when being used while having the build target set to "Web Player".
* Fix: "Build unity package" action now properly ensures that parent paths to the unity package are created.
