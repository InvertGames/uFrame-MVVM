[u]Frame Release Notes
IMPORTANT!!!: REGENERATE ANY DIAGRAMS!
1.06 5/10/2014
- Fixed: Heirarchy Icons going missing
- Fixed: When creating views that are not connected they won't be generated as an empty file.
- Fixed: You can't delete items that contain other items.  You must delete the "inner" items first.
- Fixed: When removing things it correctly removes the associations so that cascading errors don't occur. This includes Views still being generated
- Fixed: Add to scene on scene managers not working correctly
- Fixed: Some errors that occur from other non uFrame corrupted assets when polling for diagrams.
- Fixed: Other minor issues and fixes
- Modified: Now you can use ForceResolve directly from a view without manually adding the named injection.
- Modified: Controllers now have a GetByName and GetByType which can be overriden and are used by views.
- Modified: SceneManagers no longer initialize single instance types.  So a at least one view should check InitializeViewModel in the inspector

- Integration of uBehaviours and the new diagram system.
- Rename GameType to SceneManager.
- Watch ViewModels from the inspector
- Initialize ViewModels from the inspector (Element Designer generates this)
- Automatic Bindings generation.
- Controllers have been removed from the scene the Element designer will automatically Dependency inject them.
- Simplified bindings via the Element Designer
- Updated Checkers Demo (To Demonstrate Diagrams and uBehaviours)
- Update FPS Demo
- Loading screen changed to just a view in a scene and nothing more.

0.99r1 3/8/2014
- Added IBindingProvider interface so that other components can directly connect to a View Components Bind & Unbind methods.
- Removed the class constraints on Container.Resolve & Container.RegisterInstance.
- Add a User Submitted Cheat Sheet diagram.
- Other Minor Fixes/Improvements.

0.99 2/4/2014
- Added A single ViewModel to View Binding via 
	// View Class
	public SingleView ChildView {get;set;}
	// In Bind method
	this.BindToView(() => Model._SingleViewModelProperty, v => ChildView = v, () => ChildView);
- Bug Fix: Now in objects where the Inject attribute is used and there isn't a registered instance it will keep the value at null.
- Important Note: Now when commands are Executed by default it passes the viewmodel along with it. 

Used to look like this.-------------
    public virtual TWeaponViewModel Create<TWeaponViewModel>() where TWeaponViewModel : FPSWeaponViewModel, new()
    {
        var fpsWeapon = new TWeaponViewModel();
        fpsWeapon.NextZoomCommand = new CommandWith<FPSWeaponViewModel>(NextZoom);
        fpsWeapon.FireCommand = new YieldCommandWith<FPSWE>(() =>
        {
            fpsWeapon.Spread += _SpreadMultiplier;

            if (fpsWeapon.IsFiring)
                return null;

            return Fire(fpsWeapon);
        });
        fpsWeapon.RecoilAmount = _RecoilSpeed;
        fpsWeapon.ReloadCommand = new YieldCommand(() => { return Reload(fpsWeapon); });
        fpsWeapon.Spread = _Spread;
        fpsWeapon.Ammo = _RoundSize * 3;
        fpsWeapon.State = FPSWeaponState.Active;
        return fpsWeapon;
    }

You can now do this--------------------------------------------------------------
    public virtual TWeaponViewModel Create<TWeaponViewModel>() where TWeaponViewModel : FPSWeaponViewModel, new()
    {
        return new TWeaponViewModel
        {
            NextZoomCommand = new CommandWith<FPSWeaponViewModel>(NextZoom),
            FireCommand = new YieldCommandWith<FPSWeaponViewModel>(FireWeapon),
            RecoilAmount = _RecoilSpeed,
            ReloadCommand = new YieldCommandWith<FPSWeaponViewModel>(Reload),
            Spread = _Spread,
            Ammo = _RoundSize*3,
            State = FPSWeaponState.Active
        };
    }
